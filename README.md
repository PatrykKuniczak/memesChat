### MemesChat

This is app, where users can talk to each other live time, and generate funny giphy during conversation.

Working app:
  ## HOSTING LINK
  

### We decide to use:

NestJs for API and WebSockets app, cause we have extra abstraciton layer, which help us to create less code and use better solutions.

React for create frontend as web app, cause we need something more that pure JS, and React is the most popular framework and it's easy to learn and maintain
and have greate community support.

For more info about each app, go to them directory and read 'READEME.md' from inside.


We decide to use docker, for have opportunity to host our 3 app and database as one app on 1 server, to reduce communication time between each app.
If we decide to use 1 hosting, they can have servers around the world, and the request must go from e.g. USA to DE.

And it's good lesson to use docker, new experience and i can see a little of devOps work with hosting it as docker containers on web.

GIT CLONE: https://github.com/PatrykKuniczak/memesChat.git

### START YOUR WORK WITH CREATE FEATURE BRANCH FROM 'DEV'.

### AND NEXT:

    YOU MUST HAVE INSTALLED LOCALLY ON YOUR MACHINE

[DOCKER](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) IF U WANT TO HOST ENTIRE APP WITH 1 COMMAND

    AND 

[POSTGRES](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) ANYWAY, IT'S NECESSARY FOR STANDALONE AND DOCKER

---

### ENV EXPLANATION:

    FOR LOCAL (PC):
        CREATE "dev.env" FILE IN EACH APP ROOT "/config/env/" DIRECTORY
    
        YOU CAN USE VALUE FROM YOUR CASE EXAMPLE FILE E.G. 'example.mobile.env',
        BELOW I WILL SHOW AND IF NECESSARY EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ENV VALUES,

        IN EXAMPLES FILE YOU MUST REMOVE COMMENTS, I WRITE IT BECAUSE SOME VALUES ARE NOT FOR CHANGE,
        THE BETTER WAY TO CREATE ENV IS COPY FROM EXAMPLE AND IF NECESSARY CHANGE TO YOUR VALUE, BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE
        WHICH VALUES MUST BE NOT CHANGED.

---

    FOR MOBILE LOCAL:
        WORK WITH ENV FILE THE SAME WAY AS ABOVE.

        IN EXAMPLE FILE YOU HAVE HOST AND PORT FOR YOUR LOCAL/HOME INTERNET NETWORK, YOU MAY HAVE OTHER, 
        THEN TYPE IN CONSOLE 'ipconfig' AND TAKE VALUE FROM 'IPv4 Address'.
    
        FOR RUN APP CLICK ON IP "ON YOUR NETWORK:" AFTER START FRONTEND, AND WRITE THIS ADRESS ON YOUR DEVICE BROWSER
    
        IF U NEED MORE EXPLANATION OR U WANT TO USE DEVTOOLS IN YOUR MOBILE DEVICE OPEN THAT:

[TUTORIAL](https://youtu.be/TaPdgj8mucI?t=234) IF U HAVE OPTION ON YOUR DEVICE, YOU CAN ALSO DEBUG BY WI-FI.

---

    FOR DOCKER:
        YOU MUST CREATE "prod.env" FOLLOW "example.prod.env" IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS ABOVE.

---

    REMBEMBER IF YOU USE OTHER PORTS, YOU MUST CHANGE IN IN THE OTHER .ENV FILE VALUES 
    E.G. 'WS_URL' IN API

---

### ENV VALUES:

    FOR API:
        DB_TYPE=
        POSTGRES_HOST=
        POSTGRES_PORT=
        POSTGRES_USER=
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD=

        PORT=
        WS_URL=
        CLIENT_URL=
        JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
        DEVELOPMENT=true - if it's 'true', then validation is OFF, BE CAREFUL, leave empty for default validation.
        DEFAULT_JWT_TOKEN= Default token for swagger for development operation, work only on "DEVELOPMENT"=true,
        leave empty if you don't want to use it.

        GATEWAY_PORT=
        API_URL=

        REACT_APP_WS_URL=
        REACT_APP_VALIDATION_OFF=true - leave empty for leave validation active.

### CONFIGURE PRETTIER IN YOUR IDE:

    RUN "npm ci" IN ROOT(OUTER OF APPS) DIR AND PRETTIER IS IN THAT DIRECTORY AND .\node_modules\prettier.

##### E.G. FOR WEBSTORM:

[Prettier config](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2020/07/webstorm-2020-2/)

### CONFIGURE RELATIVE IMPORT PATHS IN YOUR IDE:

    IN WEBSTORM GO TO SETTING:
        EDITOR/CODE STYLE/TYPESCRIPT
            [^] USE PATHS RELATIVE TO TSCONFIG.JSON

### CONFIGURE DEFAULT BRANCH UPDATE SETTINGS:
    IN WEBSTORM GO TO SETTING:
        GIT/PUSH:
            PROTECTED BRANCH: 'main"
        /UPDATE:
            UPDATE METHOD: 'rebase'
            CLEAN WORKING TREE USING: 'stash' 
    
### AFTER CREATE ENVS AND CONFIGURE IDE:

    RUN 'npm ci' FOR EACH APP
    
    START EACH APP STANDALONE: 'npm run start:dev'
    START ON DOCKER: 'docker-compose up' (IN ENTIRE PROJECT ROOT DIRECTORY)
    
    REMEMBER THE DOCKER ENGINE MUST BE RUNNING BEFORE YOU RUN COMPOSE COMMAND
